Buttons

used to trigger the form action, the default behaviour of every button in the form is to perform the action.
any button outside the form will not perform the action

types 
1. Submit -> it will be a action button
2. button -> this will be a simple button
3. reset -> this will reset all the data in the form

input can also become a button by the type as button and the value will be the internals if the button
input type = submit will make it a submit button 

we generally do not prefer making the inputs as buttons
