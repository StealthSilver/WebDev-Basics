01.html
all the selectors until now are element selectors

*{ } -> this is the universal selector, it will apply to the whole document
this is generally not used in production 

h3{ } -> this is the element selector, applies changes to all the elements of this type on the page

h1, h3{ } -> to give the same property to multiple elements we can seperate them by commas

#myId { } -> id selector selects an element based on the value of the element's id attribute
we give one id to one element only

.myClass { } -> class selector selects an element based in their class attribute

div p{ } -> descendet selector selects all the decendents of the parent

p + h3 { } -> Adjecent sibling combinator all the elements which comes after the element prior to it on the same level

span > button { } -> child combinator selects all the elements which are direct children of the parent. just one level below
in child selector we can just select one level down

input[attr = "value"] -> attribute selector selects elements based on the presence or value of a given attribute


02.html

03.html

the CSS cascade algorithm selects the CSS declerations in order to determine the correct values for CSS properties

it applies on the same element

h3:{bqckground-color:pink;}
h3:{bqckground-color:red;}

the background color will be red

Selector Specificity

it is an algorithm that calculates the weight that is applied to a given CSS declerations

id 
class, attribute and pseudo-class
element and pseudo-element

1. id > class > element

2. more selectors > less selectors

3. if specificity is same then we check cascading

4. inline styles will be given top priority

!important -> this is used for the top most priority of the css

04.html

Inheritance in CSS

if a property is applied to a parent or grandparents, it translates to the children
some properties like width , height and border etc. are not inherited

input boxes and buttons do not inherit features from the parents by default

input{background-color : inherit} this must be added to inherit

note : we can manipulate the CSS in a website in the browser, inspect option and styles tasb
for checking what colors will suit on the website we can check them of online color palletes , like coolors and canva and mycolor.space
