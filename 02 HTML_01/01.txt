<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">                                                       (UTF-8 is the encoding)

HTML is not a case sensitive language

HTML entities are the special characters which are used to make general symbols appear, which are restricted due to 
being part of the HTMl syntax, e.g.  >, <, &hearts;

< &lt;
> &gt;
[space] &nbsp; -> non breaking space, as more than one spaces are not allowed in HTML
[heart] &heart;
& &amp;
" &quot;

the browsers render the entities by their own
