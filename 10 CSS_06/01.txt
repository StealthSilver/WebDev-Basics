grid model

the boxes formed by the lines are grid cells
the rows and columnformed by multiple boxes are grid tracks

we can check the model by using inspect in the browser

grid template
they define the line and track sizing

grid-template-rows: defines the height of a row , write as many rows we want, the remaining space will filled by rest of the content

grid-template-columns: defines the width of a column , write as many columns we want, the remaining space will filled by rest of the content

for the remaining space we can use auto

grid-template-rows : repeat(count, 1fr). we can repeat the dimentions and give the count of rows required
grid-template-columns : repeat(count, 1fr). we can repeat the dimentions and give the count of columns required


grid gaps -> for spaces between grid cells

row gap -> gap between rows

column gap -> gap between columns

grid columns

defines the items starting and ending position inside the column

grid-column-start -> line_number
grid-column-end -> line_number

grid-column : start_col / end_col
grid-column : start_col / span number

grid crow

grid-row-start -> line_number
grid-row-end -> line_number

grid-row : start_row / end_row

grid properties

for horizontal alignment
1. justify-items : for the container
2. justify-self : for the  item

for vertical alignment
1. align-items : for container
2. align-self : for item

for the same properties
1. palce-items
2. place-self

by default the grid is a block element, but we can make inline-grid for the inline properties
also we can similarly make an inline flexbox
