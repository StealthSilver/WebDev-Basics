JS OBJECT LITERAL

they are used to store keyed collections and complex entities

property => (key, value) pair
Objects are collections of properties.

there is no order in the Objects
generally objects are made by the const keyword, as the refrence of the object must not be changed, but we can change the key, value pairs

we can store arrays in objects

GET VALUES

object_name["key"] or object_name.key

if we need to access variables then we do not use the dot operator

JS Automatically onverts object keys to strings
Even if we make the number as a key, the number will be converted into string

we do not use double quotes for the keys

02.js
