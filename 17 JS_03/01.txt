STRING METHODS

methods : actions that can be performed on objects

Format 

stringName.method()

1. str.trim() -> trims whitespaces from both ends of the string
here a new string is formed which is the trimmed string, the old string is same

Strimgs are immutable in JS, No changes can be made to strings.
Whenever we do try to make a change, a new string is created and old one remains same.

2. str.toUpperCase() -> "RANDOM STRING"
3. str.toLowerCase() -> "random string"

both these methods create a new string

STRING METHODS WITH ARGUMENTS

argument is some value that we pass to the method

stringName.method(arg)

1. indexOf -> returns the first index of hte occurance of some value in the string. if the value is not present gives -1

Method Chaining -> adding multiple methods to a string


SLICE METHOD

returns a part of the original string as a new string

str = "MoveCoding"

str.slice(1,5) -> oveC

subString method works same as the slice method

REPLACE METHOD

searches a value in the string and returns a new string with the replaces value
there are no changes in the old string

it will only replace the first occurance, it si used in (regular expressions)

REPEAT

Returns a string with the number of copies of a string


02.JS

ARRAYS

Linear collection of things -> it is a linear data structure

the indexes in array start from 0

the typeof(array) is object

we can store different type of data in a single array

we can also create an empty array -> its length will be 0

Arrays are mutable -> they can be changed


ARRAY METHODDS

PUSH -> add to ends
UNSHIFT-> add to start
POP -> delete from end and return it
SHIFT -> delete from start and return it

in other languages push and pop are present in stack


03.JS

INDEXOF -> returns the index of something

INCLUDES -> searches for a value and returns a boolean


CONCAT -> merges two Arrays
the concatinated array is a new array, the old arrays do not change.

REVERSE -> reverses an array
this chnages hte original array also, it reverses it

SLICE-> opiea a portion af an array
if we write an invalid number than an empty array is returned

SPLICE -> removes / replaces / add elements in place

splice(start , deleteCont , item0 ... itemN)

it changes the original array

SORT : sorts an array in ascending or descending order

it works fine on strings, but for numbers it converts them into strings and then d=sort them so there is a unorderly fashion there

ARRAY REFRENCES

refrences means address in memory.
we can compare the arrays based on their addresses in memory

whenever an array is created then a refrence variable is created, that refrence variable knows the address of the array. 
the refrence variable stores the address in memory

comparing two arrays give false then the addresses are compared so they give false

CONSTANT ARRAYS

const arr = [1,2,3,4];

we can perform push and pop operations in the const array but we cannot reassign the values

NESTED / MULTIDIMENTIONAL ARRAY

array [array ]
