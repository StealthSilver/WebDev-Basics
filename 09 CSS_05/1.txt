Flexbox: it is a one-dimentioanl layout method for arranging items in rows or columns
it is used in responsive websites

flex model -> for every element present on the page if it is a flexbox then two axes pass through it 
1. main axis 
2. cross axis
they depend upon the direction

the parent is the flex container and the children are the flex items

display:flex -> it restricts teh elements to fit into the container
the default direction of the flexbox is row, we can change it to column to fit the elements vertically


flex direction:

row -> main axis left to right
column -> main axis top to bottom
row-reverse -> main axis right to left
column-reverse -> main axis bottom to up

justify content 
tells us how to distribute spaces between and around the content items along the main axis

flex-start -> to the starting of the main axis
flex-end -> to the end of the main axis
center -> to the center of the flex box
space-between -> extra space comes in between if it is present
space-around -> the space in between will distribute evenly in left and right
space-evenly -> all the spaces , the between and end are equal

flex wrap

sets whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines
by default it is no wrap

flex-wrap -> nowrap -> 
flex-wrap -> wrap ->
flex-wrap -> wrap-reverse ->

align items -> align the items wrt the cross axis

flex-start -> starting of the cross axis
flex-end -> end of the cross axis
center -> center wrt cross axis
baseline -> hte content comes at the same baseline
divs will arrange acording to the content

align content
distribution of space between and around content items along a flexbox cross axis

align-content -> flex-start / flex-end / center
align-content -> space-between / space-around/ space-evenly
align-content -> baseline

align self

align an individual item along the cross axis
it is higher priority that align items

align self :
flex-start -> starting of the cross axis
flex-end -> end of the cross axis
center -> center of the cross axis
baseline -> base of the content line

flex sizing
to increase and decrease the size of elements in the flexbox

flex-basis -> it sets the initial main size of the flex item

flex-grow -> if there is remaining space in the flex container then how should it be assigned to the flex item's main size
default value is 1
