Request-Response Cycle

> When we request a search engine to navigate to a website by its domain name.
    then the request is sent to the respective server of that domain.
    the server returns the HTML, CSS and JS code in response.
    that HTML, CSS and JS code is rendered on the browser and shows the UI of the website.

> the code is transferred is in form of packets.

On any website the page source contains the codebase
the inspect window makes that code packet readable and customiable
