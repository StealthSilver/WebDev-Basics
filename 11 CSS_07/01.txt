Animations in css

@keyframe Name_of_Animation{
    from{
        property : value
        }
    to{
        property : value
    }
}

this will create the blueprint of the Animations
to implement it we use the following properties

1. animation name 
2. animation-duration
3. animation-timing-function
4. animation-delay
5. animation-iteration-count -> numebr of times we want to loop the animation,  1, 2, 3 ...infinite
6. animation-direction -> normal , reverse, alternate etc


animation shorthand :
animation : name | duration | function | delay | count | directon

media queries -> helps create a responsive website (changes according to the screen)

media features - width(of viewport)
there are other media features also

@media(width: 400px){
    div{
        background-color:red;
    }
}

we have min-width and max-width features
also we have orientation according to orientation

z-index

it can be positive negative or zero

overlapping elements with larget z index covert those with smalled z index
by default the z index is 0

for the elemnts with default position or static position we cannot set the z index
